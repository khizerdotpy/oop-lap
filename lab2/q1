/*Write a C++ program that reads a group of n numbers from the user and stores them in a dynamically
allocated array of type float. Then, the program should:
 Calculate the average of the numbers.
 Find the number closest to the average.
 Print the average and the number closest to it.
 Use pointer notation wherever possible.*/
